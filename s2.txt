Introduction
Completion of test execution can be determined by several indicators, which are called "Exit Criteria". Usually test execution is considered completed when it meets one or several of below criteria:

100% test case passing rate, existing defects are identified and resolved
100% test case execution rate, with remaining defects are agreed to be deferred by business users
Test summary report is usually broadcasted upon completion of test execution, serving multiple purposes such as:

To notify project team this is the end of UAT execution (implicating the team can now focus on pre-deployment tasks)
To consolidate all test execution links in one single report, allow business users to locate the test evidences more easily, review and provide user signoff for production deployment 
To list out defects to be deferred and to obtain confirmation from business users

Attached is a sample of test report. A test summary report usually consists of below sections:

Deadline of providing business user signoff
Although this may have been discussed with business user before test summary report is sent out, it certainly does no harm to reiterate deadline for business user to provide UAT signoff in the report.

This is a table to list out outstanding items business users have to be aware of. Common items include:

To provide confirmation of remaining defects to be deferred and corresponding ETA provided by Dev team
To support in pre/post-deployment tasks, such as supplement of production data for data migration, post-deployment monitoring
To test features at pilot/production (could be due to restraint of UAT environment)


Signoff table
